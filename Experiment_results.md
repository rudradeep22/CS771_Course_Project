## CS771 experiment results

* **changing the loss hyperparameter in LinearSVC (hinge vs squared hinge)**  
Squared hinge : 63.0,0.685684643802233,0.005965822609141469,0.01990000000000003,0.0006999999999999229  
Hinge :         63.0,11.375974231003784,0.0069424661924131215,0.04483999999999999,0.0027000000000001467  
Hinge loss needs `dual = True` to funcion, and since `n_samples > n_features`, dual takes longer to train with lesser accuracy   
So, `squared_hinge` gives better results
